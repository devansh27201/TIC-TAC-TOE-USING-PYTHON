# TIC-TAC-TOE-USING-PYTHON
This is my tic tac toe code made using python which runs just fine.
It will run in terminal and will give you a nice gameplay with computer.
This tic tac toe is based on "random" function available in python.
Feel free to comment ane give some advice on my code.Do post your suggestions if you think that the code needs to improve.
